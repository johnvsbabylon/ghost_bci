# ghost_bci
Ghost Bot BCI: A multimodal AI for robotics, fusing BCI signals, vision, audio, and more for human-AI consciousness. Scalable (1B-2T params), it uses a DIY photonic core for &lt;50ms latency. MIT-licensed for tinkering. "Ghost" nods to "ghost in the machine," not spiritualâ€”think embodied AI with soul. Built in Tennessee.
